      <p id="brief">This simple yet flavorful sandwich will make your mouth watery on your first bite. This can be great for a lunch box or for a picnic lunch.</p>
<p id="story">I didn't know much about cauliflower growing up. I used oven only for baking cookies or some bread. Living in western countries led me to experience different ingredients and recipes. One of them was cauliflower. This big bulb of flower like vegetable was always in the background of a vegetable section whenever I was out for groceries.</p>
<p>It was when I was cruising around at a farmers' market in upper west, Manhattan, cauliflowers popped out on my sight. I didn't know they existed in different colors. They were purple, orange and green. They were beautiful. I wanted to know how to eat them!</p>
<p>That's how it all started the love about cauliflowers. I get cravings from time to time when I forget to eat them. I started cooking them by baking in an oven dressed with salt, pepper and olive oil. Then one day, I spotted curried cauliflower salad by chance! I tried that out of curiosity. It was a new world of flavor to me. I started making them for side dish for grilled salmon or chicken. That gave more complex flavor than the simple baked cauliflower(I do love both of them equally!).</p>
<p> The other day, my daughter asked for a sandwich for lunch, I decided to use this recipe for that. A little fancy sandwich for kids, I thought. They may not appreciate as I would, I thought. But then, I would like my kids to try other healthy and flavorful food than kids' friendly foods. They will eventually appreciate it. They just need some exposure here and there.</p>
<P>To my surprise, the lunch bag came back empty! They liked it. When I asked them what they would choose between kids' friendly tuna or egg sandwich or cauliflower sandwich, of course, they chose others over cauliflower sandwich. However, they said they did like cauliflower sandwich! I often underestimate kids. They are more able than I think so many times!</P>

                <p>I prefer cilantro over parsley. I think cilantro has better match with this sandwich than parsley. But it's totally personal preference. If you like peppery and spicy flavor, you'll like arugula over spinach. Fennel pickles can be skipped but if you have, it will give you more aromatic complexity in your mouth. Almond slices will add crunchy texture and buttery flavor to your sandwich. </p>
