      <p id="brief">This quick <strong>hongos con rajas</strong>: mushrooms and peppers quesadilla is great for a vegetarian dish when you want a light version of Mexican food.</p>
<p id="story">My family's favorite Mexican restaurant back in Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY is Haab. We used to go on a Friday night after a family swim at the YMCA. We oftentimes went with other families who came to the family swim with us. </p>
<p>Haab was a cozy, sweet spot. We liked their foods, ambient and service. People there were friendly and made us feel genuinely welcomed and comfortable. Their foods weren't too heavy and their portions were generally not too big. Therefore, the price was cheaper than other Mexican restaurants in the neighborhood. Whenever I go to a Mexican restaurant out of Park Slope, I miss Haab. There at Haab, I could enjoy without getting stuffed and try other dishes without ordering too much.</p>

<p>I tried hongos con rajas there for the first time. I think it was my husband who ordered that dish. He would have ordered a burrito but his stomach was not empty enough to take them. He wanted something lighter and found the dish and liked the description.</p>
<p>I thought the name was very interesting. Hongos con rajas. With a little knowledge I had in spanish, I translated it to fungus with strips. Hmmm.... Fungus... I could guess that could be mushrooms. And strips...? It turned out that strips meant vegetable strips, more specifically poblano pepper, in this case.</p>
<p>It was the first time trying poblano peppers. Poblano peppers taste similar to green bell peppers but with a little more kick but it's not spicy as jalapenos. When I cut or cook poblano peppers, I can taste and smell the spicy aroma in the air but when I taste it, I don't feel much spiciness in my mouth. They are earthy, rich and slightly sweet. And the texture after cooking is different than bell pepper. They become somewhat chewy and mellow. </p>
<p>When I tried the quesadilla, I liked the complexity of the flavor and texture quite a bit: the spicy aroma from poblano peppers and earthy, umami flavor from mushrooms. Different types of chewiness I got from mushrooms and peppers along with popping corns kept my mouth moving constantly. All ingredients were combined in a garlic flavored seasoning with sour cream along with melted cheese. I liked its taste balance between savory, spicy, sweet and creamy.</p>
<p>My husband liked the dish quite a bit. We started having cravings for this dish here and there. I started making it and found it fairly easy to make and I got a satisfying result, too. I hope you get to cook and enjoy the dish as well.</p>
<p>*The restaurant changed their name from Haab to México Auténtico.* </p>

            <div class="authorNote">
                <p>I used spinach wraps for this post but you can use any kind. If you would like to add protein, you can add beans like refried beans, black beans or pinto beans. You can add meat or shrimps for a non vegetarian version. Add tortilla chips on the side to add crunchiness and a company of guacamole will be even better for your taste and your diet.
