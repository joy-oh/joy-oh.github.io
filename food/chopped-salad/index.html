      <p id="brief">This fresh chopped salad will fill your mouth with many different complex favors and textures from greens, seeds, blue cheese, croutons and honey. You'll enjoy every bite finding new smack that comes one after the other.</p>
<p id="story">One day, while we were guessing each other's favorite dish, my son guessed my husband's and my favorite food as salad because he sees us eating salad for dinner most of the time. That made both of us laugh. We like salads but that's not our favorite meal. We eat them because they don't made us feel stuffed for sleeping. Of course, he didn't understand that. He is only 6 years old.</p>
<p>I'd never ordered salad in a restaurant. I thought it was a missed opportunity to eat something different. I couldn't understand people ordering salads. You can make them at home. I was thinking it's just a combinations of greens and other extra things.</p>
<p>Well... I was wrong...</p>
<p>We hadn't gone to a restaurant for a while due to the pandemic. The COVID infection rates were more controlled and Washington State guidelines changed over the course of time. With better weather, restaurants started having customers at the outdoor seatings.</p>
<p>I spotted a couple of attractive restaurants in Woodinville close to a nice trail we visited during the pandemic. I wanted to visit one of them and chose Purple Cafe to make a reservation.</p>
<p>It was a sunny afternoon. I had my breakfast pretty late and was still not hungry yet. I looked through the menu, and all options looked great, but my stomach wasn't ready for that. My kids and my husband were going to order dishes that I wanted to try, so I decided to choose something light and small. I took a look at other tables to have some ideas and spotted a salad dish that looked attractive. I asked our waiter what it was and I liked the description on the menu. So I ordered a salad for the first time.</p>
<p>I still remember the sensation I had in my mouth. A mouth full of complex favors and textures. I really loved the combination of the salad. The earthiness from gorgonzola with the sweetness from honey italian vinaigrette balanced out perfectly. The chewiness of sun dried tomatoes and crunchiness of seeds and romaine were great. The saltiness of bacon, creaminess of avocado... all were so well combined to offer great satisfaction.</p>
<p>Since then, this salad became one of our staple dishes on the table over and over again. </p>
