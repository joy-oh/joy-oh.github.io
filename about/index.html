    <h3 class="greet">Hello and Welcome to Joy+Full!</h3>
    <p class="me">
        I'm Joy: a food lover, a bird lover and a minimalist, idealist, eager persona. I'm currently living in Redmond, WA with my 2 cheerful and lovely kids and amazing husband.
        Joy+Full is my reminder of my promise and idea in life. Here you'll find food recipes, book reviews, other thoughts, travel tips and experiences that I enjoyed and wanted to share.
        I hope that these sharing help you to find a way to own your life and fully enjoy being yourself.

    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <div class="story">
        <p>I was born and raised in South Korea. I studied Horticulture and Interior Design and was a part of College Orchestra Members playing violin. I've always been 			passionate about food culture and the environment.
            <!-- I supported an environment organization in Korea during my teens.  -->
            I've always loved the beauties of nature, music and any form of art and design.</p>
        <p>I moved to NYC for ESL at the end of 2005. Later, I applied for an associate program in FIT and finished the degree and started working in the field. I met my honest, 	  funny, diligent, considerate, thoughtful and loving husband through my best friend/roommate. I moved to Ireland where his job was based right before our marriage. We 	stayed there for a couple of years. While we were there I dedicated my time to learn Spanish to communicate with my in-laws. We relocated back to NYC after 2 years. 	 Soon we had a beautiful baby girl. While I was working in the fashion industry, we had a sweet baby boy and I decided to be a homemaker and worked part time for my 	church as an admin for a bit over a year. And then we recently moved to WA for my husband's job. </p>
        <p>I do feel blessed getting to know people and different cultures throughout moving and visiting places. It definitely widened my perspective on people and the world. I 	  became more open minded on differences and resilient on changing.
            It wasn't always easy going through moving and changing to new places and adopting new life styles.
            What has sustained me steadily and held me tightly through all was the faith in Jesus encountered back in Korea when my mom was ill and passed away. My faith had evolved deeper and wider during early years in NYC when I was alone. There were only God and me. The sermons and fellowship between church members fed me spiritually and nurtured me emotionally. That's when I got my name "Joy" on one morning in the middle of the prayer. Faith in Jesus kept me from falling apart. Here are my rock verses that kept me alive. I hope some of these verses speak to you and give you hope, strength and JOY.</p>
        <ul class="verses">
            <li>"For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."-Jeremiah 29:11</li>
            <!-- <li>“I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves." -Matthew 10:16</li> -->
            <li>A psalm of David.<br>
            1
            "The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
            2
            He makes me lie down in green pastures,
            he leads me beside quiet waters,
            3
            he refreshes my soul.
            He guides me along the right paths
            for his name’s sake.
            4
            Even though I walk
            through the darkest valley,
            I will fear no evil,
            for you are with me;
            your rod and your staff,
            they comfort me.

            5
            You prepare a table before me
            n the presence of my enemies.
            You anoint my head with oil;
                my cup overflows.
            6
            Surely your goodness and love will follow me
                all the days of my life,
            and I will dwell in the house of the Lord
                forever."-Psalm 23</li>
            <!-- <li>“Surely God does not reject one who is blameless
                or strengthen the hands of evildoers.
            21
            He will yet fill your mouth with laughter
                and your lips with shouts of joy.
            22
            Your enemies will be clothed in shame,
                and the tents of the wicked will be no more.”-Job 8:20-22</li>
            <li>let their flesh be renewed like a child’s;
                let them be restored as in the days of their youth’—
            26
            then that person can pray to God and find favor with him,
                they will see God’s face and shout for joy;
                he will restore them to full well-being.
            27
            And they will go to others and say,
                ‘I have sinned, I have perverted what is right,
                but I did not get what I deserved.
            -Job 33:25-27</li> -->

            <!-- <li>because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,
                nor will you let your faithful[a] one see decay.
                You make known to me the path of life;
                you will fill me with joy in your presence,
                with eternal pleasures at your right hand.-Psalm 16:10-11</li>
            <li>The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.-Psalm 19:8</li> -->
            <!-- <li>Surely you have granted him unending blessings and made him glad with the joy of your presence.-Psalm 21:6</li>
            <li>The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me. My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him.-Psalm 28:7</li> -->
            <li>"You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,"-Psalm 30:11</li>
            <li>"When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy."-Psalm 94:19</li>
            <li>"He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;"-Psalm 105:43</li>
            <li>"Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy."-Psalm 126:5</li>
            <!-- <li>So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun.-Ecclesiastes 8:15</li>
            <li>Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do.-Ecclesiastes 9:7</li> -->
            <li>"...I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow."-Jeremiah 31:13</li>
            <!-- <li> In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.-John 16:23,24</li> -->
            <li>"Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer."-Romans 12:12</li>
            <li>"May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit."-Romans 15:13</li>
