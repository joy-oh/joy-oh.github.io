          <p>
        I've been reading self improvement/personal growth books mainly. I wanted to read a fiction to relax and enjoy for weekends to reward myself after my routine week. When my friend, Marzena, messaged me to send a book that she read to share with me, I was grateful and excited. It's Seattle based story she said. That made her to think of me and to share the book with me.
    </p>
    <p>
        The book went really fast and it was intense. There were some moments where it was so stressful for me to take all her traumatic experiences and go through the rough findings together. The story was interesting to see all the process of how each character goes through their difficulties and rise after.
    </p>
    <p>The name of the main characters is Bernadette, a very talented architect who lost herself through traumatic experiences and went missing in the end. The story is set up its course through email conversations and other documents. Through them it reveals lots of emotion from characters and how each of them process. While no one didn't know where Bernadette was about, this story lead each one to face the truth of themselves and Bernadette to find her true self.</p>
    <p>I noticed that there is a movie based on this book. I'm looking forward to watching it.</p>
