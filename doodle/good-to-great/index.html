          <p>
        After finishing The 5AM Club, I was pumped in high spirit and wanted to read another self development book. I wanted more inspiration.
        I went through my library in Audible and this book caught my eye.</p>
    <p>
        This book is based on research lead by Jim Collins who questioned if there are companies that went through difficulties and became long-term great companies.
        If so, what are their unique characters that made those companies to become great.</p>
    <p>
        The research group chose several comparison companies in several industries to study and analyze to see what makes them to leap or fail.
        They found this 7 characters to be "Good to Great".</p>
        <p class="special">7 Characters</p>
        <ul class="verses">
            <li>Level 5 Leaders</li>
            <li>First Who, Then What</li>
            <li>Confront the Brutal Facts</li>
            <li>The Hedgehog Concept</li>
            <li>A Culture of Discipline</li>
            <li>Technology Accelerators</li>
            <li>The Flywheel</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="special"></p>Although this book is talking about companies that became good to great, I couldn't stop thinking about personal growth.</p>
        <ul class="verses">
            <li>Becoming a level 5 leader: A humble but very driven person is definitely the kind of person/leader I want to be. I want to give positive impact around but it's not my place to get spot light. They are the ones who achieved from whatever impact I gave them.</li>
            <li>First who, then what: This surprised me. I thought "WHAT" is really important to begin anything. It said opposite, </li>
            <li>I did learn after many years, what drove me to a better place was really people around me. Having great, fun, humble, wise and discipline people around made me improve and grow.</li>
            <li>Confronting the Brutal Facts: From Bren√© I already learned if I can't face vulnerability which in fact, can be the Brutal Facts, I can't grow.</li>
            <li>The Hedgehog Concept: Focusing one the right goal is very important rather than starts and quits when things get on the way. The great insight was a finding the right goal from the three circles of "What you are passionate about", "What you can be best at" and "What drives your economic engine".</li>
            <li>A Culture of Discipline: Again, it's having discipline people around to me. Having my discipline husband helps me stay in discipline life.</li>
            <li>Technology Accelerators: I recently learned that if I have my phone around, I can't focus. The computer, my tablet and my phone can be just a way of entertainment or distraction unless I use them for my initial intension.</li>
            <li>The Flywheel: This one really gives me a clear image in my mind. Of course it will be hard at the beginning when you spin a Flywheel, the first few turns will be hard because it's the beginning. Later, it will be easier but you can't stop. That's how you stay great.</li>
        </ul>
