        I recently read <b>The 5AM Club</b>. This book was recommended by my friend (thanks, Amanda!).
        It was interesting, motivating and inspiring to read. I would like to recite some of quotes from the book that inspired, motivated and moved me.<br>
        I hope one of these quotes inspires and motivates you to <strong>Own Your Life</strong>.
        <ul class="quotes">
            <!-- <li>“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’ life. Don’t be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.” —Steve Jobs” </li> -->
            <li>“Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken.”</li>
            <li>“Everyone holds his fortune in his own hands, like a sculptor the raw material he will fashion into a figure... The skill to mold the material into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated.” —Johann Wolfgang von Goethe” </li>
            <li>"Procrastination is an act of self-hatred."</li>
            <li>“Nothing works for those who don’t do the work.” </li>
            <li>"What makes the best the best is not their genetics but their habits. And not the extend of their gifts, but the strength of their grit."</li>
            <li>"The flow of life rewards positive action and punishes hesitation."</li>
            <li>“Sweat more in practice, bleed less in war.” </li>
            <li>“If you knew how much work went into it, you would not call it genius.” —Michelangelo” </li>
            <li>“We will have eternity to celebrate the victories but only a few hours before sunset to win them.” —Amy Carmichael” </li>
            <li>“The life given us, by nature is short, but the memory of a well-spent life is eternal.” </li>
            <li>“All change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end,” </li>
            <li>"The life of the caterpillar must end for the glory of the butterfly to shine. The old 'you' must die before the best 'you' can be born."</li>
            <li>"Limitation is nothing more than a mentality that too many good people practice daily until they believe it's reality."</li>
            <li>"You don't have the brain you want, you have the brain you've earned... you don't have the brain you desire, you have the brain you deserve-based on how you've been operating it."</li>
            <li>"The world's going a little berserk. Too much greed and not enough good sense."</li>
            <li>“Heaven on earth is a State that anyone can create, Not a Place.”</li>
            <li>“Your past is a place to be learned from, not a home to be lived in.” </li>
            <!-- <li>"Your past is a servant that has made you all you now are - not a companion to spend time with in your present or a friend to carry into your spotless future."</li> -->
            <li>“Everything will be okay in the end. And if it’s not okay, it’s not the end,” </li>
            <li>“Your heart is always wiser than your head,” </li>
            <li>"Ultimately, you're the only person you'll be with your entire life. Why not strengthen your relationship with your greatest self, fully know your genius and start a lifetime love affair with your most noble nature?"</li>
            <li>"Relate peacefully, as much as possible, with everyone. Even one enemy is an enemy too many. Pass through life gracefully, taking the high road when conflict shows up. Should someone do you wrong, let karma do the dirty work. And let a world-class life be your revenge."</li>
            <li>“Those who hurt others silently loathe themselves” </li>
            <li>"The job of the leader is to help disbelievers embrace your vision, the powerless to overcome their weakness and the hopeless to develop faith."</li>
            <li>"Live like a hero. That's what the classics teach us. Be a main character. Otherwise what is life for?" -J.M. Coetzee"</li>
