    I love traveling. Traveling makes me refreshed, opens new views to the world and people.
</p>
<p>It has been a while since Covid-19 started. We stopped all trips including family visiting. It had been nice in a way that our family got to know each other deeply through being always together. However, we all wanted to be somewhere other than home. The vaccination started and the number had been decreasing and kids' spring break was coming. I decided to book a trip that was not too far and low key.</p>
<p>We are pretty new in WA. 6 months since we moved in. I searched somewhere close to the water where we could enjoy kayaking or boating. I found this lake Ketchum from Airbnb. It seemed a quite and relaxing place.</p>
<p>Getting there was easy. The scene changed all of sudden. We drove through open fields then suddenly we got into tree walls and lost reception and arrived to the lake.</p>
<p>This place was cozy. Not fancy, not modern, rather rusty but clean, quite, peaceful where nature lives together with us.</p>
<p>The neighbor was the host. We could get any help in no time. They were welcoming and friendly. While being greeted by the host, we also greeted by a muscovy duck. While unpacking out luggages in the house, deers were peaking in us.</p>
<div class="travelPhotoContainer">

</div>
<p>It was a beautiful day so we decided to enjoy the water after settling down.</p>
<p>We started with a pontoon boat. As we sat out, another muscovy duck leaded the way, a brandt looked out for us. When we went to the middle, we found many tree swallows gliding over the lake happily. On our way back, as we were close to the shore, 2 great blue herons greeted us.</p>

    <img class="right" src="/img/travel/IMG_3726b.jpg" alt="Pedal boat">
</div>
<p>We decided to try a paddle boat and a row boat. I went with our son to the paddle boat and my husband went with our daughter to the row boat. we raced each other. It was sweet. As we were almost back to the shore, we sighted an osprey swooped down catching a fish in front of us. It was breath taking.</p>
<p>The host mentioned they saw a barn owl flying from a tree to a tree in front of their house and there were eagles flying over their area. It gave me a pleasant peace by the fact that we and the nature coexisted there.</p>
<p>The night there was very quite, relaxing and peaceful. Not only because of the area but also there was no wifi available. We could hear only chimes by wind. We played board games and enjoyed S'mores every night.</p>

</div>
<p>While we were there, we visited nearby attractions. We visited Anacortes and Tulip Town.</p>
<p>Anacortes was still cold to visit. We had nice lunch at a small local restaurant.</p>

<p>Tulips were all bloomed yet but daffodils were fully bloomed beautifully.</p>

<p>There were bird habitats we could visit. We visited 2 Skagit Wildlife Areas</p>
<p>This area called Leque Island. This place looked surreal. This place plays critique role in young aquatics and bird species because this island connects two bays and have these young species to be ready for big water. However, it has only 15% of the area intact.</p>
<img class="travel" src="/img/travel/IMG_1478.jpg" alt="Skagit Wildlife Area-Leque Island">
<p>We visited another Skagit Wildlife Area called Wiley Slough. This place had lots of birds enjoying their time there. We could see Great Blue Herons, Bald Eagles, Sandpipers, Savannah Sparrows and many more birds that I couldn't get to see but just heard their chirping and calling each other. It was serene.</p>

<p>We really had great time in Lake Ketchum area enjoying the nature and wildlife peacefully.</p>
